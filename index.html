                <p>Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly
                    on a 6.8-acre high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature
                    conservancy. The setting is exceptional, and the home is
                    every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is
                    enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic
                    flooring, custom maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous
                    windows, and incredible views.

                    a beautiful wooded area.
